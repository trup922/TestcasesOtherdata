I understand you want to focus on comparing just the building model part of these images using JImageHash. Here's an approach to accomplish this:

1. Extract the region of interest (ROI):
First, we need to crop the images to focus only on the building model. Since the building's position seems consistent across images, we can define a fixed rectangle for cropping.

```java
public BufferedImage cropBuildingModel(BufferedImage fullImage) {
    // Adjust these values based on the exact position of the building in your images
    int x = fullImage.getWidth() / 3;  // Approximate start of the building from left
    int y = fullImage.getHeight() / 6;  // Approximate start of the building from top
    int width = fullImage.getWidth() / 2;  // Approximate width of the building
    int height = 2 * fullImage.getHeight() / 3;  // Approximate height of the building
    
    return fullImage.getSubimage(x, y, width, height);
}
```

2. Compare the cropped images using JImageHash:

```java
import com.github.kilianB.hash.Hash;
import com.github.kilianB.hashAlgorithms.PerceptiveHash;
import com.github.kilianB.hashAlgorithms.AverageHash;
import com.github.kilianB.hashAlgorithms.DifferenceHash;

public boolean compareBuildings(BufferedImage referenceImage, BufferedImage capturedImage, double threshold) {
    BufferedImage croppedReference = cropBuildingModel(referenceImage);
    BufferedImage croppedCaptured = cropBuildingModel(capturedImage);
    
    PerceptiveHash pHash = new PerceptiveHash(32);
    AverageHash aHash = new AverageHash(64);
    DifferenceHash dHash = new DifferenceHash(64);
    
    Hash pHash1 = pHash.hash(croppedReference);
    Hash pHash2 = pHash.hash(croppedCaptured);
    Hash aHash1 = aHash.hash(croppedReference);
    Hash aHash2 = aHash.hash(croppedCaptured);
    Hash dHash1 = dHash.hash(croppedReference);
    Hash dHash2 = dHash.hash(croppedCaptured);
    
    double pSimilarity = 1 - pHash1.normalizedHammingDistance(pHash2);
    double aSimilarity = 1 - aHash1.normalizedHammingDistance(aHash2);
    double dSimilarity = 1 - dHash1.normalizedHammingDistance(dHash2);
    
    double avgSimilarity = (pSimilarity + aSimilarity + dSimilarity) / 3;
    
    Logger.info("Perceptive Hash Similarity: {}", pSimilarity);
    Logger.info("Average Hash Similarity: {}", aSimilarity);
    Logger.info("Difference Hash Similarity: {}", dSimilarity);
    Logger.info("Average Similarity: {}", avgSimilarity);
    
    return avgSimilarity >= threshold;
}
```

3. Use this method in your test:

```java
public boolean verifyBuildingModel() {
    BufferedImage referenceImage = ImageIO.read(new File("path/to/reference/image.png"));
    BufferedImage capturedImage = Shutterbug.shootPage(driver, ScrollStrategy.VIEWPORT_ONLY).getImage();
    
    return compareBuildings(referenceImage, capturedImage, 0.85);  // Adjust threshold as needed
}
```

This approach:
1. Crops both the reference and captured images to focus on the building model.
2. Uses three different hash algorithms for comparison, which can help account for different types of visual changes.
3. Calculates an average similarity across the three methods.
4. Allows you to set a threshold for determining if the images are similar enough.

You may need to fine-tune the cropping rectangle and similarity threshold based on your specific images and requirements. Also, ensure you have proper error handling and logging in place.

Remember, this method assumes the building is consistently positioned in your images. If its position can vary significantly, you might need to implement a more sophisticated method to locate the building within the image before cropping.
