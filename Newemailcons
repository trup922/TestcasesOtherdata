Sure, here are some test cases for the scenario you described:

1. **Verify Initial Functionality**: 
   - Input: Existing email consumer process without the new notification event types.
   - Expected Output: Confirmation that the email consumer process operates correctly without the new event types.

2. **Update Secret File with New Event Types**:
   - Input: Update the secret file with the new notification event types (boarding, settlement).
   - Expected Output: Successful update of the secret file with the new event types.

3. **Trigger Email Consumer Process**:
   - Input: After updating the secret file, trigger the email consumer process.
   - Expected Output: Confirmation that the email consumer process successfully identifies and processes the new event types without any code changes.

4. **Validate Handling of New Event Types**:
   - Input: Send notifications for the new event types (boarding, settlement) and verify email processing.
   - Expected Output: Email notifications are generated and sent for the new event types without any issues.

5. **Ensure No Impact on Existing Event Types**:
   - Input: Send notifications for existing event types and verify email processing.
   - Expected Output: Confirmation that existing event types are still processed correctly and that there are no unintended side effects from the addition of new event types.

6. **Verify Flexibility for Future Changes**:
   - Input: Update the secret file with additional new event types as per business requirements.
   - Expected Output: Successful processing of the newly added event types without requiring any code changes in the email consumer process.

7. **Test Error Handling**:
   - Input: Introduce errors in the secret file or incorrect formatting of new event types.
   - Expected Output: Proper error handling by the email consumer process, such as logging errors and failing gracefully without impacting the overall functionality.

8. **Regression Testing**:
   - Input: After any changes to the email consumer process or the secret file, perform regression testing.
   - Expected Output: Confirmation that all existing functionalities are still intact and that the new changes haven't introduced any regressions.

These test cases cover various aspects of the requirement, ensuring that the email consumer process can handle new event types efficiently without requiring frequent code updates.
