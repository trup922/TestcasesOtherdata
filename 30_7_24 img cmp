I understand your situation better now. Dealing with 3D models in a canvas element does present unique challenges for image comparison, especially across different resolutions. Given that you can't select individual elements, let's consider some alternative approaches:

1. Full canvas screenshot comparison with scaling:

```java
// Capture the entire canvas
WebElement canvasElement = driver.findElement(By.tagName("canvas"));
Screenshot screenshot = Shutterbug.shootElement(driver, canvasElement);

// Scale both the captured and base images to a consistent size
Screenshot scaledScreenshot = screenshot.scale(0.5);
Screenshot scaledBaseScreenshot = baseScreenshot.scale(0.5);

// Compare with a tolerance
boolean isEqual = scaledScreenshot.equals(scaledBaseScreenshot, 0.1); // 10% tolerance
```

2. Image hash comparison:
Instead of pixel-by-pixel comparison, use perceptual hashing algorithms which are more resilient to resolution changes.

```java
import com.github.kilianB.hash.Hash;
import com.github.kilianB.hashAlgorithms.PerceptiveHash;

// Assuming you have a method to convert Screenshot to BufferedImage
BufferedImage capturedImage = convertToBufferedImage(screenshot);
BufferedImage baseImage = convertToBufferedImage(baseScreenshot);

PerceptiveHash pHash = new PerceptiveHash(32);
Hash hash1 = pHash.hash(capturedImage);
Hash hash2 = pHash.hash(baseImage);

double similarity = hash1.normalizedHammingDistance(hash2);
boolean isSimlar = similarity > 0.9; // 90% similarity threshold
```

3. Region of Interest (ROI) comparison:
If certain parts of the 3D model are more important for your test, you can focus on specific regions.

```java
// Capture the entire canvas
Screenshot fullScreenshot = Shutterbug.shootElement(driver, canvasElement);

// Define regions of interest (x, y, width, height)
Rectangle roi1 = new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 200);
Rectangle roi2 = new Rectangle(300, 300, 150, 150);

// Compare ROIs
boolean roi1Equal = fullScreenshot.equals(baseScreenshot, roi1, 0.1);
boolean roi2Equal = fullScreenshot.equals(baseScreenshot, roi2, 0.1);
```

4. Resolution-aware base images:
Maintain separate base images for different resolutions and choose the appropriate one.

```java
Dimension canvasSize = canvasElement.getSize();
String resolution = canvasSize.getWidth() + "x" + canvasSize.getHeight();
Screenshot baseScreenshot = Screenshot.loadFromFile("base_image_" + resolution + ".png");

Screenshot screenshot = Shutterbug.shootElement(driver, canvasElement);
boolean isEqual = screenshot.equals(baseScreenshot, 0.1);
```

5. Feature extraction and comparison:
Use computer vision libraries to extract and compare features from the images, which can be more resilient to resolution changes.

```java
import org.opencv.core.*;
import org.opencv.features2d.*;

// Assuming you have methods to convert Screenshot to Mat
Mat img1 = convertToMat(screenshot);
Mat img2 = convertToMat(baseScreenshot);

ORB orb = ORB.create();
MatOfKeyPoint keypoints1 = new MatOfKeyPoint(), keypoints2 = new MatOfKeyPoint();
Mat descriptors1 = new Mat(), descriptors2 = new Mat();

orb.detectAndCompute(img1, new Mat(), keypoints1, descriptors1);
orb.detectAndCompute(img2, new Mat(), keypoints2, descriptors2);

BFMatcher matcher = BFMatcher.create(Core.NORM_HAMMING, true);
MatOfDMatch matches = new MatOfDMatch();
matcher.match(descriptors1, descriptors2, matches);

// Analyze matches to determine similarity
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or provide more details on implementation?
