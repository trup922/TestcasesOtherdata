Sure, here are some test cases you could consider:

1. **Basic Test Case:**
   - Input: A DB2 table TMD_WS_TERM_EVENT with terminal IDs and their statuses, where one or more terminal IDs have status changed from 'A' to another value.
   - Expected Output: A list of terminal IDs that have changed status from 'A' to any other value.

2. **Empty Table Test Case:**
   - Input: An empty DB2 table TMD_WS_TERM_EVENT.
   - Expected Output: An empty list or no output, as there are no terminal IDs with status changes.

3. **All Terminals Active Test Case:**
   - Input: A DB2 table TMD_WS_TERM_EVENT where all terminal IDs have status 'A'.
   - Expected Output: An empty list or no output, as there are no status changes from 'A' to any other value.

4. **No Status Change Test Case:**
   - Input: A DB2 table TMD_WS_TERM_EVENT where terminal statuses remain unchanged ('A').
   - Expected Output: An empty list or no output, as there are no status changes from 'A' to any other value.

5. **Multiple Status Changes Test Case:**
   - Input: A DB2 table TMD_WS_TERM_EVENT where multiple terminal IDs have their status changed from 'A' to different values.
   - Expected Output: A list containing terminal IDs with status changes from 'A' to any other value.

6. **Terminal IDs with Other Statuses Test Case:**
   - Input: A DB2 table TMD_WS_TERM_EVENT where some terminal IDs have statuses other than 'A'.
   - Expected Output: An empty list or no output, as only terminals with status 'A' transitioning to another value are of interest.

7. **Terminal IDs with Multiple Status Changes Test Case:**
   - Input: A DB2 table TMD_WS_TERM_EVENT where some terminal IDs have their status changed from 'A' to another value multiple times.
   - Expected Output: A list containing terminal IDs with multiple status changes from 'A' to any other value.

8. **Boundary Test Case:**
   - Input: A DB2 table TMD_WS_TERM_EVENT with a large number of terminal IDs and statuses, with one or more terminal IDs on the boundary of the data type limit.
   - Expected Output: A list containing terminal IDs with status changes from 'A' to any other value, ensuring the functionality handles large datasets and boundary conditions appropriately.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios to ensure the functionality of reading the DB2 table and retrieving the required terminal IDs with status changes is thoroughly tested.
