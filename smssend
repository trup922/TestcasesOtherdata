Sure, here are some test cases for the feature:

1. **Verify Database Insertion**:
   - Input: Sample SMS data with all required fields
   - Action: Attempt to insert the data into the database
   - Expected Output: Data should be successfully inserted into the database without any errors.

2. **Verify Mandatory Fields**:
   - Input: Sample SMS data missing one or more mandatory fields (e.g., user_id, notification_type, country_code, etc.)
   - Action: Attempt to insert the incomplete data into the database
   - Expected Output: System should reject the insertion and provide an appropriate error message indicating the missing field(s).

3. **Verify Message Body Logging**:
   - Input: Sample SMS data with a message body
   - Action: Insert the data into the database
   - Expected Output: The message body should be successfully logged into the "Message_body" field of the database.

4. **Verify Message Body Retrieval**:
   - Input: Previously inserted SMS data
   - Action: Retrieve the data from the database
   - Expected Output: The retrieved data should include the message body stored in the "Message_body" field.

5. **Verify Data Integrity**:
   - Input: Inserted SMS data
   - Action: Retrieve and compare the inserted data from the database with the original input data
   - Expected Output: All fields in the retrieved data should match the original input data, ensuring data integrity.

6. **Verify Unique Message ID**:
   - Input: Two SMS data entries with the same message ID
   - Action: Attempt to insert both entries into the database
   - Expected Output: System should reject the insertion of the second entry with a duplicate message ID and provide an appropriate error message.

7. **Verify Message Status Logging**:
   - Input: Sample SMS data with a status (e.g., delivered, pending, failed)
   - Action: Insert the data into the database
   - Expected Output: The status should be successfully logged into the "status" field of the database.

8. **Verify Processing Status Logging**:
   - Input: Sample SMS data with a processing status (e.g., processed, pending)
   - Action: Insert the data into the database
   - Expected Output: The processing status should be successfully logged into the "processed_status" field of the database.

9. **Verify Message Timestamp Logging**:

   - Expected Output: The timestamp should be successfully logged into the "message_timestamp" field of the database.

10. **Verify Querying by User ID**:
    - Input: Sample SMS data with a specific user ID
    - Action: Query the database for SMS entries associated with that user ID
    - Expected Output: The query should return all SMS entries matching the specified user ID.

11. **Verify Querying by Notification Type**:
    - Input: Sample SMS data with a specific notification type
    - Action: Query the database for SMS entries associated with that notification type
    - Expected Output: The query should return all SMS entries matching the specified notification type.

12. **Verify Querying by Date Range**:
    - Input: Sample SMS data with a specific date range
    - Action: Query the database for SMS entries within that date range
    - Expected Output: The query should return all SMS entries falling within the specified date range.

These test cases cover various aspects of the feature, ensuring that SMS data is properly logged into the database and can be retrieved accurately when needed.
