I understand you want to create a PowerPoint presentation about your test automation framework based on the information provided in the screenshots and the technologies you've mentioned. While I can't create the actual PPT file for you, I can provide an outline with key points that you can use to build your presentation. Here's a suggested structure:

Title Slide: "QA Automation Framework Overview"

Slide 1: Framework Architecture
- Main components: Cucumber, Selenium, TestNG, PicoContainer
- Additional libraries: JImageHash, Logback, REST Assured
- Reporting: Cucumber Reports

Slide 2: Project Structure
- src/main/java
  - com.tp.api: API-related classes (e.g., ZephyrApiClient)
  - com.tp.browsers: Browser management (e.g., DriverFactory)
  - com.tp.constants: Constant definitions
  - com.tp.context: Test context management
  - com.tp.pages: Page object classes
  - com.tp.utilities: Utility classes

Slide 3: Project Structure (continued)
- src/test/java
  - com.tp.hooks: Cucumber hooks
  - com.tp.runner: TestNG runner
  - com.tp.stepdefs: Cucumber step definitions
- src/test/resources
  - features: Cucumber feature files
  - projectionimages: Reference images for visual testing

Slide 4: Key Features
- BDD approach using Cucumber
- Cross-browser testing with Selenium WebDriver
- Dependency injection with PicoContainer
- Visual regression testing using JImageHash
- API testing capabilities with REST Assured
- Comprehensive logging with Logback

Slide 5: Test Execution
- TestNG for test orchestration
- Parallel execution capabilities
- Cucumber tags for test organization and selection

Slide 6: Reporting
- Cucumber Reports for detailed test results
- Screenshots for failed tests
- Visual difference highlighting for image comparisons

Slide 7: CI/CD Integration
- Maven for build and dependency management
- Jenkins integration (if applicable)
- Version control with Git

Slide 8: Best Practices
- Page Object Model for better maintainability
- Reusable step definitions
- Externalized configuration (env_config.properties)
- Consistent naming conventions

Slide 9: Future Enhancements
- Potential areas for improvement
- Planned additions to the framework

Conclusion Slide: Summary and Q&A

This outline covers the main aspects of your framework based on the information provided. You can expand on each point with more details, code snippets, or diagrams as needed. Remember to add visuals like screenshots of your project structure, sample code, or test reports to make the presentation more engaging and informative.
