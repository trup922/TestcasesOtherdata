Dear Team,

As many of you know, today marks my last working day at Worldpay. It’s been an incredible journey since I joined FIS in 2018, and I feel privileged to have been a part of the Worldpay project since 2021.

I want to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to each one of you. Working alongside such a talented and dedicated team has been a truly rewarding experience. Your support, collaboration, and camaraderie have made my time here memorable and fulfilling.

During my time on the Merchant Communication Hub project, I learned a great deal. Witnessing the merchant comms journey from its inception to its production deployment has been both challenging and immensely gratifying. I am proud of what we have accomplished together and will always cherish the memories and friendships I’ve made.

I am especially grateful to our supportive Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Directors, and all my amazing team members, whose guidance and encouragement have been invaluable. Your collective efforts and dedication have inspired me to grow both professionally and personally.

Although I am moving on to new opportunities, I will carry the lessons and experiences I’ve gained here with me.

Please stay in touch! You can reach me at [your personal email address or LinkedIn profile].

Wishing you all continued success and happiness.

Thank you and goodbye!

Warm regards,
[Your Name]

Goodbye and Best Wishes
